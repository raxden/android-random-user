Random User Code Test

Task
You are working for a company showing random users information (RandomUser Inc.). As a good company based on random users data they want to show random information about random users.

Your task for this code test is to design an Android application with these requirements:

Download a list of random users from http://randomuser.me/ API.
Be careful, some users can be duplicated. You should take this into account and do not show duplicated users. If Random User API returns the same user more than once you have to store just one user inside your system.
Show a list of random users with this information:
User name and surname.
User email.
User picture.
User phone.
Add a button or any similar infinite scroll mechanism to retrieve more users and add them to your current users list.
Add a button to each cell or a similar interaction to delete users. If you press that button your user will  not be shown anymore in your user list. Even if the user is part of a new server side response.
Your user interface should contain a textbox to filter users by name, surname or email. Once the user stop typing, your list will be updated with users that matches with the search term.
If you press the cell you have to show another view with the user detailed information:
User gender.
User name and surname.
User location: street, city and state. 
Registered date.
User email.
User picture.
The user information should be persistent across application sessions.
Test your code, think in the most important parts of your application and write tests.
Try to solve this code test like a real life project. Think in the architecture and design of your model and try to implement it as modular as possible.
API Description
You can obtain a list of random users in this URL: http://api.randomuser.me/?results=40. The full documentation of the API is available in the following link: https://randomuser.me/documentation.

API JSON response sample:

randomuser.json

What we look for
This task is designed to give us an idea of how you think when faced with a limited amount of time to solve a task of significant complexity. You will need to prioritize what you feel is important.
The overall look and feel of the application is important. Do your best to use the appropriate platform frameworks.
We are also interested in how you structure your code so that it's easily extendable, complies with best OO practices, and is easy to modify/understand by others.
We are going to pay special attention to your tests. Please, write them carefully and stay focused on the most important parts of your application.
If you base the application architecture in existing templates/projects, make sure you adapt it to the test needs (eg: remove anything that doesn't make sense). In any case, however, give proper credit to the existing code.


Submitting your solution
Hand in your solution along with any notes, comments, and assumptions you have made while working on the solution via eÂ­mail to the Schibsted employee who sent you this test.

Delivery will be done uploading the code in a public git repository system like GitHub or bitbucket. Or, if you prefer, bundle all files into a zip (with the local git repository inside). Remember to use descriptive commit messages.

This technical test is NOT time boxed, but time is taken into consideration just as any other factor when reviewing your solution.
