/**
 * Abstract (Dialog)Fragment for all (Dialog)Fragments and child (Dialog)Fragments to extend.
 * This contains some boilerplate dependency injection code and activity [Context].
 *
 *
 * **WHY EXTEND DialogFragment?**
 * [DialogFragment]s are simple extensions of Fragments. DialogFragments can be shown as a
 * dialog floating above the current activity or be embedded into views like regular fragments.
 * Therefore, supporting both Fragments and DialogFragments for dependency injection can simply be
 * achieved by having the base fragment class (this) extend DialogFragment instead of Fragment.
 * We could have separate base classes for Fragments and DialogFragments but that would produce
 * duplicate code. See See https://github.com/vestrel00/android-dagger-butterknife-mvp/pull/64
 *
 *
 * Note that as of Dagger 2.12, the abstract base framework type
 * [dagger.android.DaggerDialogFragment] has been introduced for subclassing if so desired.
 *
 *
 * **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**
 * We could extend [dagger.android.DaggerDialogFragment] so we can get the boilerplate
 * dagger code for free. However, we want to avoid inheritance (if possible and it is in this case)
 * so that we have to option to inherit from something else later on if needed.
 *
 *
 * **VIEW BINDING**
 * This fragment handles view bind and unbinding.
